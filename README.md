# Data-Driven-Market-Expansion-Strategy-for-DoorDash-s-Health-Conscious-Meal-Kits
This project examines DoorDash’s potential entry into the health-conscious meal kit delivery market through a data-driven approach. Utilizing segmentation analysis, cluster analysis, regression modeling, sentiment analysis, geotargeting, positioning, and predictive analytics, the study identifies key consumer segments and market opportunities to optimize strategic decision-making.

Segmentation analysis identifies two primary consumer groups: Balanced Homemakers, who prioritize nutritional value and meal variety, and Convenience Seekers, who favor quick and effortless meal solutions. Cluster analysis further refines these segments based on purchasing behavior, dietary preferences, and frequency of online food orders, allowing for a more targeted marketing strategy.

To quantify the factors influencing consumer purchasing decisions, regression analysis determines that pricing, freshness, and convenience are the most significant drivers of subscription intent. Additionally, sentiment analysis of social media and customer reviews highlights a strong preference for fresh, organic, and sustainable meal solutions, providing insights into consumer expectations and brand positioning.

Geotargeting identifies urban markets with high demand potential, where young professionals and health-conscious consumers exhibit a strong interest in meal kit subscriptions. Based on these findings, a positioning strategy is developed to differentiate DoorDash’s meal kit offerings by emphasizing freshness, sustainability, and convenience—key attributes aligned with industry trends.

Predictive analysis enhances sales forecasting accuracy by 1.93x, enabling better inventory planning and marketing budget allocation. The final recommendations include launching targeted digital marketing campaigns, implementing a personalized meal kit subscription model, offering first-month discounts and bundled promotions, and introducing biodegradable packaging to reinforce sustainability commitments.

By leveraging advanced analytics across multiple dimensions, this study provides a strategic framework for DoorDash to establish a competitive presence in the health-conscious meal kit market while aligning with evolving consumer preferences.
